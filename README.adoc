= Spring Boot 4 HTTP Service Interface Clients - Usage Example

== Client registration
* Using @ImportHttpServices
* AbstractHttpServiceRegistrar

== Client configuration
* Use application.properties
** Service group: base-url, timeout, custom http header, etc
* Use RestClientHttpServiceGroupConfigurer
** Add custom error handler
** Add interceptor
** Set base-url
** Add HTTP header
** Allow further filtering of client within the group

== Client for OAuth2 protected service
* Configure OAuth2 client in application.properties
* Enable http client to call oauth2 protected service
** Use OAuth2RestClientHttpServiceGroupConfigurer and @ClientRegistrationId
*** Check commit history of OAuth2ClientConfig.java to find out
** Use RestClientHttpServiceGroupConfigurer to add oauth2 interceptor to each client 
*** This is the currnet implementation

== Client fo service protected by HTTP basic authentication

== Custom message converter 

== Global configuration
* Timeouts
* HTTP factory choice (Apache HTTP Component, Jetty, JDK)

== Unit tests 

== Versioning example

== Default methods in http client interface for API convenience

== Not using for @ClientRegistrationId for OAuth2 client configuration

== Todo

=== Usage example of HttpServiceProxyRegistry if there are multiple client proxies of the same type 
* See details from https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-http-service-client

=== Use RestClientCustomizer for global RestClient customization 

== Others

=== OAuth2 security configuration
* Using @ClientRegistrationId to decorate http client interface and its method seems weird

=== Usage example of HttpServiceArgumentResolver 
* See https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-http-service-client.custom-resolver
* See branch "custom-argument-resolver"
* May use default method as shown in https://github.com/rstoyanchev/springio25-service-registry/blob/github-user/src/main/java/demo/github/service/IssueService.java#L40
